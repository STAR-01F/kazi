1. Added Firebase dependency via npm install Firebase
2. For federated auth services my email (tlawal86@gmail.com) is being used as a failsafe, this
   would need to be changed to a group STARS email if/when we have one
3. Added new dirs --> services, firebase & login (for testing, to be replaced with AM's), register, reset
4. New dependency --> React Firebase Hooks (npm install --save react-firebase-hooks
)
