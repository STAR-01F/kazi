# AWS SAM Developer Readme

A guide to deploying lambdas via AWS' SAM CLI

## Setup

To get started, install both the AWS CLI and SAM CLI -
[instructions on aws](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)

## Getting Started

Create a file called **template.yaml** within the relevant directory. Within, define the resource(s) that you wish to create - [some examples here](https://medium.com/carsales-dev/api-gateway-with-aws-sam-template-c05afdd9cafe)

## Validation/Testing

### Docker

With Docker active on your system, you're able to test your lambda locally before deployment

```bash
sam local invoke
```

and even pass events to it.

```bash
sam local invoke -e {adirectory}/{yourfilename}.json
```

Let's assume your lambda reads the name field of the request body.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Bobby Axelrod"
  }
]
```

Create a {yourfilename}.json stored within {adirectory}. Call the above prompt and assess the output on the terminal

#### Linting

```bash
sam validate --lint
```

This reads and template.yaml and displays any errors that may occur or nil.

## Deployment

Having successfully tested your lambda with sam invoke and fixed any errors raised by the lint, you may wish to deploy.

This happens in two steps :

```bash
sam build
```

This will build your assets using the config within your template.yaml. AWS SAM CLI creates a .aws-sam (within which will be your build and a build.toml fle)

Donâ€™t edit any code under the .aws-sam/build directory.
Instead, update your original source code in your project folder
and run sam build to update the .aws-sam/build directory.

Always run SAM build when making changes to your original source code

We deploy to two different stacks, one for development and one for production. Ensure you specify your desired stack by using one of the following flags. If no flag is specified, it defaults to the dev stack. Do not update the production stack unless the code has been fully tested in the development stack.

```bash
sam deploy --config-env dev
```

```bash
sam deploy --config-env prod
```

The above flag will deploy your assets which can be viewed on AWS' CloudFormation service. You'll have a few simple y/n prompts to answer after which the deployment is concluded, if successful.
